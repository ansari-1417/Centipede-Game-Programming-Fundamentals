# Centipede-Game-Programming-Fundamentals
This project recreates classic Centipede game as part of our Programming Fundamentals coursework using C++. Over a month, I implemented core features, enhanced with modern textures and sprites via SFML. I added a Space Shooter theme, gameplay features like increasing centipede speed and length, and progressive challenges for an engaging experience.
